            <abstract>This GIS data set represents oyster coverage for available study areas in the state of Florida. Not all areas have been mapped, but this dataset represents the oyster data available to FWRI as of November 2023. Polygons representing dead oyster mass have been removed as of January 2022. Previous compilations included both live and dead oysters. Please contact GISLibrarian@MyFWC.com for the full source datasets used in this compilation. Source dates vary and many studies are much older than the compilation date. See the Source Information section for more details.</abstract>
            <purpose>This GIS data set was developed to represent the most recent oyster mapping available in Florida for current statewide display and analysis. Not all areas have been mapped. This data set includes areas that were not previously mapped in other statewide compilations. This data set is not appropriate for time series comparisons to previous statewide compilations. These data are for statewide mapping and analysis only. The original regional data sets may contain more detailed oyster attribution schemes. Contact GIS Librarian to request the source data sets.</purpose>

This effort is intended as a supplement to previous aerial photointerpretation of oyster reefs conducted by the Southwest Florida Water Management District in 2018 (seagrass_swfwmd_2018). Imagery used for photointerpretation of oyster reefs included ESRI base imagery (NASA Blue Marble: Next Generation and icubed Nationwide Prime 1 m resolution imagery) and Google Earth version 7.3.3 satellite and aerial historic imagery. Only live oyster reefs on natural substrate were classified for this effort.

                <srccontr>Source: FWRI, Suwannee Sound Oyster Reef Mapping 2019. This mapping effort focused on previously unmapped intertidal oyster reefs located in tidal creeks and near-shore waters located to the north and south of the Suwannee River. This effort is intended as a supplement to previous aerial photointerpretation of oyster reefs conducted by AGRA Baymont, Inc. for the Suwannee River Water Management District (SRWMD) in 2001. Imagery used for photointerpretation of oyster reefs included Landsat imagery (USGS/NASA) and Florida Department of Transport mosaics (FDOT 2011-2014). Twelve percent of the reefs identified were visited for groundtruthing and it was determined the accuracy rate was 99%. This mapping effort did not separate between live and dead patches of oyster reef. Full report for 2019 available: http://ocean.floridamarine.org/OIMMP/Resources/Suwannee River Oyster Mapping 2019.pdf Some polygons in this distribution were replaced by newer data from the Horseshoe Bay mapping efforts by FWRI in 2021.</srccontr>

                <srccontr>This data set gives oyster polygons in the Panhandle and Big Bend areas, interpreted from 1:24,000 natural color aerial photography. It is not an exhaustive mapping effort of oysters, as oysters were only mapped in areas where seagrass was also mapped. There are local areas where more recent mapping efforts have been completed. This data set was used only in areas where no more recent data were available. Some polygons in this distribution near the Steinhatchee River were removed due to confirmation of oyster bed loss during ground truthing efforts associated with the Horseshoe Bay mapping efforts by FWRI in 2021.

These polygons are used in the Panhandle estuaries except where more recent 2021 data from the Escambia County and The Nature Conservancy are available in Pensacola Bay. Note: A set of hand-drawn oyster maps were created by FDACS personnel for the panhandle using NOAA navigation charts and verified in survey and monitoring efforts. These maps were then digitized by FWC to create the FDACS 2009 – 2010 dataset. While a report is not available regarding the methodology for the creation of these maps, these oyster maps were published in Section 17 of the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission Regional Management Plan (VanderKooy 2012).

                <srccontr>This data set includes the location and coverage area of most major oyster reefs within the Sebastian River. Each oyster reef was mapped using Real-Time Kinematic GPS (RTK GPS). Transect surveys were conducted at 1-m intervals across the face of the reef, perpendicular to the long-axis of the reef and extending from border to border. The latitude, longitude and height (elevation) data for each 1-m interval were collected using the RTK GPS rover unit. No data points were taken outside the perimeter of the reef. There were several small polygons that were DISSOLVEd by FWRI to remove overlap. Percent live/dead was recorded in the source data. A polygon is classified as a live bed if any live oysters were found within it. As of January 2022, all oysters classified as "Dead" from this source have been removed from the compilation. All remaining polygons were retained. Citation: Gambordella M, McEachron L, Beals C, Arnold WS. 2007.

                <srccontr>Source: FWRI, Horseshoe Beach and Deadman Bay Oyster Reef Mapping 2021. This mapping effort focused on intertidal oyster reefs located in tidal creeks and near-shore waters between Horseshoe Beach and Deadman Bay. Imagery used for photointerpretation included ESRI base imagery (NASA Blue Marble: Next Generation and i-cubed Nationwide Prime 1-m resolution imagery) and Google Earth version 7.3.3 satellite and aerial historic imagery (Google Inc., Mountain View CA) (imagery from 2017-2021). Only live oyster reefs were classified for this effort. Ground truthing is described in the full report, available at: https://ocean.floridamarine.org/OIMMP/Resources_2021/Horseshoe_DeadmanBay_Oyster_Mapping_final.pdf Ground truthing in 2021 for the Horseshoe region revealed that some reefs that were mapped by the USGS in 1992 near the Steinhatchee River were no longer present, so those polygons were removed. In addition, ground truthing north of Horseshoe Beach required the replacement of some of the reefs occurring the Suwannee River which were mapped by FWRI in 2019.</srccontr>

                <srccontr>This is a polygon file containing data for an oyster survey conducted in fall 2003 in the St. Lucie Estuary, Florida. Oyster bed perimeter was mapped using GPS. No oysters were mapped in channel areas greater than 8 feet deep since initial grid-based surveys did not find evidence of oysters at that depth. LIVE_BED attribute indicated whether a bed was live or not and this was translated into the OYSTER attribute. In areas of overlap with 2011 SFWMD data, the more recent data were used. As of January 2022, all oysters classified as "Dead" from this source have been removed from the compilation. All remaining polygons were retained.

                <srccontr>Source: FWRI, Suwannee Sound and Springs Coast Intertidal Oyster Reef Mapping 2023. This mapping effort focused on intertidal oyster reefs in the greater Suwannee Sound and along the Withlacoochee and Crystal Rivers. Imagery used for photointerpretation included Imagery basemaps in ArcMap (Source: Esri, DigitalGlobe, GeoEye, i-cubed, USDA FSA, USGS, AEX, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, swisstopo, and the GIS User Community) and Google Earth Pro 7.3.6 (Google LLC; Mountain View, CA). Only live oyster reefs were classified for this effort. Ground truthing is described in the full report, available at: https://ocean.floridamarine.org/OIMMP/Resources_2023/TIGMappingReport-SuwanneeSpringsCoast-12132023.pdf. Groundtruthing in 2023 for this mapping effort revealed that some reefs that were mapped by the SRWMD in 2001 and USGS in 1992 were no longer present, so those polygons were removed. In addition, this map replaces some polygons from the FWRI 2019 mapping effort.</srccontr>

                <procdesc>Oyster polygons were selected from the source data sets. Each file was given new attributes to classify based on its source data set and the date of the source data, as well as a generic DESCRIPT attribute to indicate that each polygon represents "Oyster". In areas where source files overlapped, the newest data was used. The "oysters_apalachbay_2006", "benthic_srwmd_2001", and "oysters_big_bend" data sets overlapped the "oysters_nw_fl_1992" data set so their extent was ERASEd from the 1992 dataset. Extent footprints for "benthic_srwmd_2001" and "oysters_big_bend" were estimated based on the description of the study area given by Suwannee River Water Management District since these files only represented oysters, not the full bounding box of the project. Along the northern and southern edges of the study areas, polygons from the "oysters_nw_fl_1992" were preserved if it was unclear whether or not the area had been included in the SRWMD studies. The following data sets contained some small overlaps within the source files: "oysters_tampabay", "oysters_Loxahatchee_Rv_2004", and "oysters_sebastian_2006_poly". These overlaps were eliminated by a DISSOLVE of the full data set. The data set was loaded into ArcSDE.</procdesc>
